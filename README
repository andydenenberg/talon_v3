Monitor Status of critical devices

Keeps track of status and response delays over time.

Each site being monitored has an associated time series.
The time series records for each site is recorded in a model called time_log.

For simplicity, the system uses uses html form put and post for login and to update the status and time_log info.  Json is used to read info from the repository.

The site checker was originally written in perl, but I decided to keep everything unified in one language, Ruby

Currently there is no separation between checking and logging.  The status flag if set to yes, enables the checker and it will both check and store the result in time_logs.  An improvement would be to allow the device to be check more frequently than the the delays is stored (or discarded).
